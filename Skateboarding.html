	Skateboarding is more than a sport or a hobby, it's an art form. It doesn't matter what tricks you can or cant do
	it's how you do them. Perfecting tricks over and over until you are satisfied. Taking hours to do a clean line, 
	getting busted up because of it, and being proud of your achievement. Skateboarding hooks you because of how it rewards you,
	it's not showing off to your friends, theres something about moving a piece of wood under your feet in a specific way
	that's so satisfying. That's why i love it.
