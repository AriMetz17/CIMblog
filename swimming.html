	"The trouble with some forms of exercise, 
	like training for a marathon in the summer, 
	is that if you do not properly hydrate then you 
	could end up with big problems (not to mention 
	with a bad sunburn if you do not use the proper sunscreen).

    Swimming indoors means you will not get all 
    sweaty as the water is constantly cooling 
    you down. However, keep in mind that you can 
    still get heat stroke if you are swimming outside 
    in the hot sun (kids are especially at risk), 
    so take the proper precautions."
